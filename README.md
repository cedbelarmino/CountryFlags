# Project Description
CountryFlags is an Android application developed to display list of Countries around the world and their respective primary information such as flags, Capital City, population and etc. This App allows user to scroll through the list and choose the country they want information from. In addition, the location of the country on the map is also displayed along with the country information, however for this feature to be available, I used a personal API key for google maps. I can provide the key if needed for for testing and verification of the feature.
